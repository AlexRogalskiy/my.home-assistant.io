<div class="section-header">What does My Home Assistant solve?</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    In the documentation and when the community is helping users, we often want
    to link them to a specific page in their instance. However, each Home
    Assistant instance is hosted at a different url. This website works around
    that issue by allowing users to specify their Home Assistant url.
  </p>
  <p>
    My Home Assistant allows users to store the URL of their instance so that
    the documentation can link the user directly to their instance. This data is
    stored in your browser and never leaves your computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Home Assistant documentatino links you to a place in your instance,
    they will link you to My Home Assistant. My Home Assistant will then forward
    this to Home Assistant, which will open the right page.
  </p>
  <p>
    All this logic happens in your browser. At no point will any data leave your
    network. None of the supported redirects take any action. They either end up
    on a page that will provide you with information about your instance or help
    you start an action.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-header" id="supported-pages">Supported pages</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    The following pages are supported:
  </p>
  <ul>
    {% for redirect in redirects %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ redirect | redirectExamplePath }}">
        {{ redirect.description | title }}
      </a>
      <br />
      <i>Introduced in Home Assistant Core {{ redirect.introduced }}.</i>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  Why do I get a 404 Not Found when I open a link?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    This website requires an instance to run at least Home Assistant 2021.3.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  Will this allow anyone to link me to any url on my instance?
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    No, this is not possible. All pages in Home Assistant that are linkable and
    their supported parameters are defined in this website and in the `my`
    integration in Home Assistant.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section-header">
  How can I disable this website from working for my instance
</div>
<div class="card-content">
  <p>
    This website requires Home Assistant to have the `my` integration enabled.
    If you don't have this integration set up, links from this website won't
    work.
  </p>
</div>
